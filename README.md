# Computer-Vision-Motion-Tracking
Tracks a certain coloured object and tracks its centre in space.
Currently set to detect a red object using the built in webcam then follows it and calculates the x and y coordinates of the object's centre 
relative to the the number of pixels from the webcam. 

Uses OpenCV and Numpy. 

Here is the masked image of a red pen lid being tracked as an example.
